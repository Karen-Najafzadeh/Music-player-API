## How to launch the project  
To deploy this project clone it on your machine.

First of all you need to create a virtual environment and install the dipendecies there

This is my favourite way of doing it


```bash
  python -m venv some_name_for_your_venv
```  

Next, activate the environment


```bash
  .\your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
``` 

Then go ahead and install the essential requirements for this project


```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

Now you're good to go. just run the project with this command


```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```  
I have a little database where i've added some primary data. Now if you like you can drop the database and create your own, it's totally ok.
